# This readme is for SHELLcast version 0.2, released on April 23rd, 2003

# Notes:
#   Right now I can't imagine a single thing to put here.

# How to run SHELLcast (just one of the many ways):
#   CONSOLE_PROGRAM_TO_RUN | perl SHELLcast.pl

# How to get something useful out of it:
#   Well, I can think of a few useful things this program can do.  Here's a
#   quick list:
#     - Show ANSI-based Tetris on the latest (only?) BBS you found to an
#       audience 
#     - Show someone how to run a console-based application
#     - Give tutorials on how to hack into some poor unsuspecting soul's
#       poorly protected Linux box
#     - Show someone what happens when you dial up a COCOT with your modem
#     - Let people spy on your daily shell activities out of the goodness of
#       your heart

# If you have Perl's Time::HiRes module you can now record and playback your
# sessions (or "rebroadcast" them).

  # How to record your sessions:
  #   perl scr.pl HOSTNAME PORT > RECORDFILE

  # How to playback your sessions:
  #   cat RECORDFILE | perl scp.pl

  # How to rebroadcast your sessions:
  #   cat RECORDFILE | perl SHELLcast.pl
