# This NAQ is for SHELLcast version 0.1, released on April 3rd, 2003

# What is SHELLcast?
#   SHELLcast is a Perl script that allows others to monitor a console-based
#   program that you run.

# Why does everything have the pound/hash/splat/octothorpe/grid/square
# character in front of it in this file?!
#   This stuff used to be in the beginning of the source file until I realized
#   that that was really stupid.

# Why are you releasing this?
#   There are a bunch of reasons.  I'll be sure to update this section in the
#   next release.

# This program sucks!
#   E-mail me at ntheory@cloud9.net.  Suggest something, submit something,
#   but please just don't let the hate fester in your head!  How else will
#   this program get better?  OK, OK, if you really, really don't like it/me
#   just write something better and e-mail it to me.  I love free GPS software.
